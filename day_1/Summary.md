**Welcome \& Introduction**



* A 30-day challenge to learn Python step by step.
* Designed for beginners and professionals.
* Covers Python 3 with practical examples, exercises, and projects.
* Encourages joining the Telegram group and YouTube lessons for support.



**Why Python?**



* Easy to learn, close to human language.
* Used widely in industries (Google, data science, machine learning, web, desktop apps).
* Popular in the data science and ML community.



**Environment Setup**



1. Install Python (version 3.6 or higher recommended).
2. Verify installation with python --version.
3. Python runs scripts interactively in the Python Shell (>>>).
4. Errors are common; debugging is essential (e.g., SyntaxError).



**Basic Operations in Python Shell**



* Supports mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division, exponentiation.
* Comments in Python use # for single line or triple quotes for multi-line.



**Setting up a Code Editor**



* Visual Studio Code recommended for writing Python scripts.
* Create project folder 30DaysOfPython and first file helloworld.py.
* Use print() function to display results when running .py files.



**Python Basics**



* Syntax \& Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
* Comments: Used for readability, ignored during execution.



**Data Types:**



Numbers: Integer, Float, Complex

String: Text enclosed in single/double/triple quotes

Boolean: True or False

List: Ordered, can store multiple data types

Dictionary: Unordered key-value pairs

Tuple: Ordered, immutable collection

Set: Unordered, unique values only



Use type() function to check data type of a value.



**Running Python Files**



Run .py files via VS Codeâ€™s run button or terminal command:



python helloworld.py
